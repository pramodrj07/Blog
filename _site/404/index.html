    "title": "Leader Election in a kubernetes service",
    "body": "2023/08/04 - Electing a Leader Using Controller-runtime in Kubernetes: Kubernetes is an open-source container orchestration platform that has revolutionized the way we deploy, manage, and scale containerized applications. One crucial aspect of managing applications in a Kubernetes cluster is ensuring high availability and fault tolerance. To achieve this, electing a leader among multiple instances of a controller is a common practice. In this blog post, we’ll explore how to implement leader election using the controller-runtime library in Go, making our controllers resilient and robust. The transmitting operations such as sending and receiving to a channel are blocking by default. This means that when the data is sent into a channel the control is blocked till a goroutine reads from the other end of the channel. Similarly the read from the channel is blocked till the other end has a gorouting writing data into it Why Leader Election?: In a Kubernetes environment, you might have multiple instances of a controller running to manage a set of resources. These controllers might be responsible for tasks like scaling, syncing, or managing custom resources. To prevent conflicts and ensure orderly execution, only one instance should be the leader at any given time. Leader election helps achieve this by designating one instance as the leader while the others remain followers. The leader performs tasks, and in the event of a failure, another instance is automatically elected as the new leader. This mechanism ensures consistent and controlled execution of operations. Using controller-runtime for Leader Election: The controller-runtime library is a powerful toolkit for building Kubernetes controllers in Go. It provides a framework for writing efficient and scalable controllers, including built-in support for leader election. Prerequisites: Before we begin, make sure you have the following prerequisites:  A working Kubernetes cluster.  Go programming language installed.  Basic familiarity with Kubernetes concepts and Go programming. Implementation Steps: Let’s implement leader election using controller-runtime step by step. Step 1: Set Up Your Controller Project: Create a new Go project and import the necessary libraries: package mainimport (   context    flag    os    sigs. k8s. io/controller-runtime/pkg/manager   // Import other necessary packages)Step 2: Define the LeaderElectionConfig: func main() {  var metricsAddr string  var enableLeaderElection bool  flag. StringVar(&amp;metricsAddr,  metrics-bind-address ,  :8080 ,  The address the metric endpoint binds to.  )  flag. BoolVar(&amp;enableLeaderElection,  enable-leader-election , false,  Enable leader election for controller manager. Enabling this will ensure there is only one active controller manager.  )  flag. Parse()  leaderElectionID :=  my-controller-lock  // Unique ID for leader election  // . . . (initialize other components)  // Create a new controller manager with leader election configuration  mgr, err := manager. New(cfg, manager. Options{    LeaderElection:   enableLeaderElection,    LeaderElectionID:  leaderElectionID,    MetricsBindAddress: metricsAddr,    // . . . (other options)  })  if err != nil {    // Handle error    os. Exit(1)  }  // . . . (initialize and start controllers)}Step 3: Start the Manager: // Start the manager	if err := mgr. Start(ctrl. SetupSignalHandler()); err != nil {    // Handle error    os. Exit(1)  }}Step 4: Test Leader Election: Deploy your controller to the Kubernetes cluster and observe the leader election behavior. You should see only one instance of your controller acting as the leader. Conclusion: Implementing leader election in Kubernetes controllers is crucial for ensuring reliable and fault-tolerant operation. By using the controller-runtime library, you can easily incorporate leader election functionality into your controllers, enhancing their resilience and availability. In this blog post, we’ve covered the basics of leader election using controller-runtime and provided a simple example to get you started. As you delve deeper into building Kubernetes controllers, mastering leader election will become an essential skill in maintaining the stability of your applications. Remember that leader election is just one piece of the puzzle in creating robust controllers. To fully harness the power of Kubernetes and controller-runtime, continue exploring the documentation and experimenting with more advanced features.

    "body": "2020/11/17 - While designing a system that is optimal for your application, one would probably prioritize and emphasize on the cool features, modern platforms, scalability and resiliency. While the security aspect may be considered as a second priority, it would be good to understand it at a deeper level and best pratices in industry. Often unheard but extremely important terminology in security is “Hardware Security Module”. Hardware Security Module(HSM) are often specialized hardware devices that can store, protect and manage the digital keys. They are capable of handling encryption, decryption, authentication, signature functions such as signing certificates and a lot of other cryptographic funtions. We will find that HSMs are deployed in all the corporate and Banking sectors which have multiple applications running in a data center. The application will request HSMs for keys while initializing, signing data or for certificates. The secure feature of HSM is that the keys(private keys) that are stored in it will never ever be exposed to the outside world. An application can only send a request for the data to be signed but will never get its hands on the private key. This is usually done with a parameter called “handle”. The keys are tamper proof as well. For example, if there is a visible sign of tampering, the HSM would delete that specific key rather than exposing it outside or perform any related operation. How cool is that? My experience in integrating a Hardware Security Module(TPM) into the Cloud has led me to question and investigate the security aspect everytime I work on a new project. I would probably spend an entire day in discussion when a developer says that the secrets and keys are on test/development server. Checkout my work here on Trusted Platform Module HSM "

Though one can imagine the security to be handled at the API gateway and external load balancer level, the need arises when the communication takes places between the microservices inside the cluster. How would a traffic be fine grained to a specific pod of a microservice for your sticky session?How would the mTLS be established between the micorservices running within your cluster?Is it possible to introduce your testing code to your existing running prod instances without an outage? All the above questions and more can be solved using a Servicemesh. Kubernetes is aimed to ease the job of a application developer.

    "body": "2019/01/19 - Software Defined Networking(SDN) architecture grew substantially as a core part of the Cloud computing. My experience on SDN has been in the early days of a popular open source project called OpenDaylight. As compared to the conventional computer networking, the SDN is fascinating in the way that thousands of virtual swtiches can be programmed dynamically on demand with a centralized controller. The control plane is an application which will generate and apply the configuration on the virtual switches like OpenvSwitch on scale. I drove the effort to enable the Quality of Service feature in Opendaylight. This required integration between OpenStack which typically is user facing and the downstream OpenDaylight which would work behind the scene to configure underlying switches. Opendaylight has a plugin architecture so that it could support various upstream projects other than openstack and downstream projects where network vendors could develop plugins specfic to their hardware. The control plane is typically an application which would expose APIs to receive the request and interpret the data to generate the switch configuration and apply it on target switches. OpenDaylight has been a confluence of network enthusiasts from top network vendors and Cloud Providers. It was a good to learn and contribute. "
