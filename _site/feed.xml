&lt;p&gt;Well.. Well.. Why would we even need an infra layer on top of an awesome infra layer? Like k8s..&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Though kubernetes offers excellent way to deploy, manage and scale you applications and microservices, it still needs to be secured. Though one can imagine the security to be handled at the API gateway and external load balancer level, the need arises when the communication takes places between the microservices inside the cluster.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;How would a traffic be fine grained to a specific pod of a microservice for your sticky session?
How would the mTLS be established between the micorservices running within your cluster?
Is it possible to introduce your testing code to your existing running prod instances without an outage?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All the above questions and more can be solved using a Servicemesh.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Kubernetes is aimed to ease the job of a application developer. Wouldn’t a developer want to offload the Security, Traffic and network responsibility to someone else?&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>pramod</name></author><category term="featured" /><summary type="html">Service Mesh is typically an infrastructure layer to secure, manage and connect your Microservices.</summary><media:thumbnail xmlns:media="http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/" url="http://localhost:4000/mundana-theme-jekyll/assets/images/servicemesh.jpg" /></entry><entry><title type="html">Welcome to my Blog</title><link href="http://localhost:4000/mundana-theme-jekyll/welcome-to-jekyll/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Welcome to my Blog" /><published>2019-01-21T00:00:00-08:00</published><updated>2019-01-21T00:00:00-08:00</updated><id>http://localhost:4000/mundana-theme-jekyll/welcome-to-jekyll</id><content type="html" xml:base="http://localhost:4000/mundana-theme-jekyll/welcome-to-jekyll/">&lt;p&gt;Welcome to my Blog.

&lt;p&gt;Software Defined Networking(SDN) architecture grew substantially as a core part of the Cloud computing. My experience on SDN has been in the early days of a popular open source project called &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.opendaylight.org/&quot;&gt;OpenDaylight&lt;/a&gt;. As compared to the conventional computer networking, the SDN is fascinating in the way that thousands of virtual swtiches can be programmed dynamically on demand with a centralized controller. The control plane is an application which will generate and apply the configuration on the virtual switches like OpenvSwitch on scale.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I drove the effort to enable the &lt;a href=&quot;https://git.opendaylight.org/gerrit/c/neutron/+/60170&quot;&gt;Quality of Service&lt;/a&gt; feature in Opendaylight. This required integration between OpenStack which typically is user facing and the downstream OpenDaylight which would work behind the scene to configure underlying switches. Opendaylight has a plugin architecture so that it could support various upstream projects other than openstack and downstream projects where network vendors could develop plugins specfic to their hardware. The control plane is typically an application which would expose APIs to receive the request and interpret the data to generate the switch configuration and apply it on target switches. OpenDaylight has been a confluence of network enthusiasts from top network vendors and Cloud Providers. It was a good to learn and &lt;a href=&quot;https://git.opendaylight.org/gerrit/q/owner:pramod.raghavendra.jayathirth%2540intel.com&quot;&gt;contribute&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>pramod</name></author><category term="featured" /><summary type="html">Software Defined Networking</summary><media:thumbnail xmlns:media="http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/" url="http://localhost:4000/mundana-theme-jekyll/assets/images/sdn.jpg" /></entry><entry><title type="html">Let’s GO and buid the microservice?</title><link href="http://localhost:4000/mundana-theme-jekyll/Build-your-microservice/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Let's GO and buid the microservice?" /><published>2018-11-16T00:00:00-08:00</published><updated>2018-11-16T00:00:00-08:00</updated><id>http://localhost:4000/mundana-theme-jekyll/Build-your-microservice</id><content type="html" xml:base="http://localhost:4000/mundana-theme-jekyll/Build-your-microservice/"></content><author><name>pramod</name></author><summary type="html"></summary><media:thumbnail xmlns:media="http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/" url="http://localhost:4000/mundana-theme-jekyll/assets/images/1.jpg" /></entry></feed>
